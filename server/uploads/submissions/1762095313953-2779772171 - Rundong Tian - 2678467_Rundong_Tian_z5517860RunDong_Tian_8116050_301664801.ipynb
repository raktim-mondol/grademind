    "## Assignment 1: Constraint Satisfaction Search\n",
    "\n",
    "@Authors: **Wayne Wobcke, Alfred Krzywicki, Stefano Mezza**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due Date:** Week 5, Friday, October 17, 5.00pm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment concerns developing optimal solutions to a scheduling problem inspired by the scenario of a manufacturing plant that has to fulfil multiple customer orders with varying deadlines, but where there may be constraints on tasks and on relationships between tasks. Any number of tasks can be scheduled at the same time, but it is possible that some tasks cannot be finished before their deadline. A task finishing late is acceptable, however incurs a cost, which for this assignment is a simple (dollar) amount per hour that the task is late.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *fuzzy scheduling* problem in this scenario is simplified by ignoring customer orders and having just one machine and a number of *tasks*, each with a fixed duration in hours. Each task must start and finish on the same day, within working hours (9am to 5pm). In addition, there can be *constraints*, both on single tasks and between two tasks. One type of constraint is that a task can have a deadline, which can be “hard” (the deadline must be met in any valid schedule) or “soft” (the task may be finished late &ndash; though still at or before 5pm &ndash; but with a “cost” per hour for missing the deadline). The aim is to develop an overall schedule for all the tasks (in a single week) that minimizes the total cost of all the tasks that finish late, provided that all the hard constraints on tasks are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "More technically, this assignment is an example of a *constraint optimization problem* (or *constrained optimization problem*), a problem that has constraints like a standard Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), but also a *cost* associated with each solution. For this assignment, we will use a *greedy* algorithm to find optimal solutions to fuzzy scheduling problems that are specified as text strings. However, unlike the greedy search algorithm described in the lectures on search, this greedy algorithm has the property that it is guaranteed to find an optimal solution for any problem (if a solution exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will use the AIPython code of Poole & Mackworth. You are given code to translate fuzzy scheduling problems specified as text strings into CSPs with a cost, and you are given code for several constraint solving algorithms &ndash; based on domain splitting and arc consistency, and based on depth-first search. The assignment will be to implement some missing procedures and to analyse the performance of the constraint solving methods, both analytically and experimentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is an individual assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write your answers in **this** notebook and submit **this** notebook on Moodle under **Assignment 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name your submission ``<zid>-<firstname>-<lastname>.ipynb`` where ``<firstname>-<lastname>`` is your **real** (not Moodle) name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you set up AIPython (as done below) so the code can be run on either CSE machines or a marker's own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not submit any AIPython code. Hence do not change any AIPython code to make your code run.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure your notebook runs cleanly (restart the kernel, clear all outputs and run each cell to check).\n",
    "\n",
    "- After checking that your notebook runs cleanly, run all cells and submit the notebook **with** the outputs included (do not submit the empty version).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure images (for plots/graphs) are **included** in the notebook you submit (sometimes images are saved on your machine but are not in the notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not modify the existing code in this notebook except to answer the questions. Marks will be given as and where indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want to submit additional code (e.g. for generating plots), add that at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important: Do not distribute any of this code on the Internet. This includes ChatGPT. Do not put this assignment into any LLM.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Late Penalties\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard UNSW late penalties apply (5% of the value of the assignment per day or part day late).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Unlike the CSE systems, there is no grace period on Moodle. The due date and time is 5pm **precisely** on Friday October 17.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: You can submit as many times as you want before the due date, but if you do submit before the due date, you cannot submit on Moodle after the due date. If you do not submit before the due date, you can submit on Moodle after the due date.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plagiarism\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that ALL work submitted for this assignment must be your own work and no sharing or copying of code or answers is allowed. You may discuss the assignment with other students but must not collaborate on developing answers to the questions. You may use code from the Internet only with suitable attribution of the source. You may not use ChatGPT or any similar software to generate any part of your explanations, evaluations or code. Do not use public code repositories on sites such as github or file sharing sites such as Google Drive to save any part of your work &ndash; make sure your code repository or cloud storage is private and do not share any links. This also applies after you have finished the course, as we do not want next year’s students accessing your solution, and plagiarism penalties can still apply after the course has finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "All submitted assignments will be run through plagiarism detection software to detect similarities to other submissions, including from past years. You should **carefully** read the UNSW policy on academic integrity and plagiarism (linked from the course web page), noting, in particular, that collusion (working together on an assignment, or sharing parts of assignment solutions) is a form of plagiarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, do not use any contract cheating “academies” or online “tutoring” services. This counts as serious misconduct with heavy penalties up to automatic failure of the course with 0 marks, and expulsion from the university for repeat offenders."

    "### Fuzzy Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSP for this assignment is a set of variables representing tasks, binary constraints on pairs of tasks, and unary constraints (hard or soft) on tasks. The domains are all the working hours in one week, and a task duration is in hours. Days are represented (in the input and output) as strings ‘mon’, ‘tue’, ‘wed’, ‘thu’ and ‘fri’, and times are represented as strings ‘9am’, ‘10am’, ‘11am’, ‘12pm’, ‘1pm’, ‘2pm’, ‘3pm’, ‘4pm’ and ‘5pm’. The only possible values for the start and end times of a task are combinations of a day and times, e.g. ‘mon 9am’. Each task name is a string (with no spaces), and the only soft constraints are the soft deadline constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Constraints:** These specify a hard requirement for the relationship between two tasks.\n",
    "- **Hard Domain Constraints:** These specify hard requirements for the tasks themselves.\n",
    "- **Soft Deadline Constraints:** These constraints specify that a task may finish late, but with a given cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each soft constraint has a function defining the *cost* associated with violating the preference, that the constraint solver must minimize, while respecting all the hard constraints. The *cost* of a solution is simply the sum of the costs for the soft constraints that the solution violates (and is always a non-negative integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the list of possible constraints for a fuzzy scheduling problem (comments below are for explanation and do **not** appear in the input specification; however, the code we supply *should* work with comments that take up a full line): \n",

    "\n",
    "- 2.2 domain splitting with arc consistency\n",

On the other hand, when T is a non-assigned task, on the basis of my code, the calculation of my function is the minimum cost, when the domain of a task is narrowed down, the possibility of achieving the minimum cost does not increase, so the distribution of h(n) will hold or increase, it is impossible to decrease. \n",

Once a complete assignment with the smallest total cost is found, it must be the global optimum. This is because every additional task assignment can only add to or preserve the existing cost, never reduce it. Hence, any cost-driven search function will naturally lead to an optimal solution."

    "Explanation of the generated figure: The red dotted line represents the performance of the solver without using the cost function, while the blue dotted line corresponds to the solver that applies the cost-guided variable ordering strategy (the optimized version). The red shaded area indicates the degree of fluctuation in the performance of the zero-cost solver, measured as the variation in the number of nodes expanded across different random problem instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost-guided heuristic achieves its maximum relative benefit at n = 5, with a 96.47% reduction in the number of expanded nodes. Although the percentage gain slightly decreases at n = 7 (to 93.34%), the absolute reduction in search nodes (20,000 – 1,333 = 18,667 nodes saved) is the largest, highlighting the substantial computational advantage of the cost-based strategy under higher problem complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also noted that at n = 3, the blue dotted line slightly exceeds the red one. This is likely due to small-sample randomness rather than a true performance drop. I also attempted to include more values in the `NS` list, but the program took an extremely long time to complete, likely because the computational complexity increases exponentially as more variables are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, as the problem size increases, it can be observed that incorporating the cost function consistently improves solver efficiency and significantly reduces the number of expanded nodes."

    "2. Compare with completeness and optimlity\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2.1 DFS: DFS has completeness, because in this particular finite situation, it is not infinite, meaning that DFS can visite all the nodes, so it can guarantee to find a soluion if one exists, without consider the aspect of time. In terms of optimlity, DFS algorithm can not guarantee to return an optimal solution as the first solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 2.2 DFS-MRV: DFS-MRV has completeness, I think the reason is roughly same as the DFS, still backtracking search over a finite space. As for optimlity, DFS-MRV also can not guarantee to return an optimal solution as the first solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The example if DFS-MRV easier than DFS: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Before the example, let's look at the theory of MRV: it prioritizes the variables with the fewest optional values. So my example is: assuming we have five tasks, we need to assign the start time of every task, for example from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. We also assume task A must be done in timeslot 1, so the domain of A is {1}, and the other tasks cannot overlap with a task that is already working. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Firstly, we look at the DFS algorithm. A possible situation is that task B chooses timeslot 1, and it performs a lot of operations using DFS, but that is completely wrong because task A already occupies timeslot 1, which the DFS algorithm does not know. So when DFS later visits task A, it will perform a backtracking operation. We can see that DFS will visit many invalid branches in this specific case. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Secondly, the Depth-First Search solver using forward checking with the Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) heuristic will avoid this mistake. When task A is assigned to timeslot 1, forward checking will update the domains of other tasks immediately, removing or discarding timeslot 1 from their candidate sets. The domains of B, C, D, and E become {2, 3, 4, 5}. All plans that overlap with task A will be avoided, which saves a lot of space and time. The search tree will shrink quickly and only require occasional backtracking. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    In conclusion, DFS-MRV reduces redundant exploration by updating domains and selecting the most constrained variables first, leading to faster and more efficient search than standard DFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compare first solution and optimal solution\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4.1 DFS: the first solution found by general DFS is usually not the best and even is a lower quality compared to the optimal solution, mainly because the normal DFS algorithm just execute all the nodes in the case, like blind, without any trick, so basically, the first solution of DFS is not good.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4.2 DFS-MRV: this algorithm will create the first solution better than DFS, since MRV prioritizes the most constrained variables and avoids many invalid or inconsistent partial assignments early. Probably, the first solution is not the best, not the optimal solution, but at least much better than normal DFS.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compare DFS-MRV with DFS in terms of the number of nodes expanded\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5.1 DFS: DFS expands nodes in a fixed order without considering variable constraints, which often leads to exploring many unnecessary nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- 5.2 DFS-MRV: DFS-MRV uses the Minimum Remaining Values heuristic to prioritize the most constrained variables. This reduces the number of invalid or inconsistent assignments early, so it typically expands fewer nodes than plain DFS algorithm."
