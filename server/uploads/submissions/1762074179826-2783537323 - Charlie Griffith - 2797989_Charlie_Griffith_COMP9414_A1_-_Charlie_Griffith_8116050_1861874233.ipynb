    "## Assignment 1: Constraint Satisfaction Search\n",
    "\n",
    "@Authors: **Wayne Wobcke, Alfred Krzywicki, Stefano Mezza**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Due Date:** Week 5, Friday, October 17, 5.00pm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment concerns developing optimal solutions to a scheduling problem inspired by the scenario of a manufacturing plant that has to fulfil multiple customer orders with varying deadlines, but where there may be constraints on tasks and on relationships between tasks. Any number of tasks can be scheduled at the same time, but it is possible that some tasks cannot be finished before their deadline. A task finishing late is acceptable, however incurs a cost, which for this assignment is a simple (dollar) amount per hour that the task is late.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *fuzzy scheduling* problem in this scenario is simplified by ignoring customer orders and having just one machine and a number of *tasks*, each with a fixed duration in hours. Each task must start and finish on the same day, within working hours (9am to 5pm). In addition, there can be *constraints*, both on single tasks and between two tasks. One type of constraint is that a task can have a deadline, which can be “hard” (the deadline must be met in any valid schedule) or “soft” (the task may be finished late &ndash; though still at or before 5pm &ndash; but with a “cost” per hour for missing the deadline). The aim is to develop an overall schedule for all the tasks (in a single week) that minimizes the total cost of all the tasks that finish late, provided that all the hard constraints on tasks are satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "More technically, this assignment is an example of a *constraint optimization problem* (or *constrained optimization problem*), a problem that has constraints like a standard Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), but also a *cost* associated with each solution. For this assignment, we will use a *greedy* algorithm to find optimal solutions to fuzzy scheduling problems that are specified as text strings. However, unlike the greedy search algorithm described in the lectures on search, this greedy algorithm has the property that it is guaranteed to find an optimal solution for any problem (if a solution exists).\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment will use the AIPython code of Poole & Mackworth. You are given code to translate fuzzy scheduling problems specified as text strings into CSPs with a cost, and you are given code for several constraint solving algorithms &ndash; based on domain splitting and arc consistency, and based on depth-first search. The assignment will be to implement some missing procedures and to analyse the performance of the constraint solving methods, both analytically and experimentally.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- This is an individual assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write your answers in **this** notebook and submit **this** notebook on Moodle under **Assignment 1**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Name your submission ``<zid>-<firstname>-<lastname>.ipynb`` where ``<firstname>-<lastname>`` is your **real** (not Moodle) name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure you set up AIPython (as done below) so the code can be run on either CSE machines or a marker's own machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not submit any AIPython code. Hence do not change any AIPython code to make your code run.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure your notebook runs cleanly (restart the kernel, clear all outputs and run each cell to check).\n",
    "\n",
    "- After checking that your notebook runs cleanly, run all cells and submit the notebook **with** the outputs included (do not submit the empty version).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make sure images (for plots/graphs) are **included** in the notebook you submit (sometimes images are saved on your machine but are not in the notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do not modify the existing code in this notebook except to answer the questions. Marks will be given as and where indicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you want to submit additional code (e.g. for generating plots), add that at the end of the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Important: Do not distribute any of this code on the Internet. This includes ChatGPT. Do not put this assignment into any LLM.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Late Penalties\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard UNSW late penalties apply (5% of the value of the assignment per day or part day late).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Unlike the CSE systems, there is no grace period on Moodle. The due date and time is 5pm **precisely** on Friday October 17.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important: You can submit as many times as you want before the due date, but if you do submit before the due date, you cannot submit on Moodle after the due date. If you do not submit before the due date, you can submit on Moodle after the due date.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plagiarism\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that ALL work submitted for this assignment must be your own work and no sharing or copying of code or answers is allowed. You may discuss the assignment with other students but must not collaborate on developing answers to the questions. You may use code from the Internet only with suitable attribution of the source. You may not use ChatGPT or any similar software to generate any part of your explanations, evaluations or code. Do not use public code repositories on sites such as github or file sharing sites such as Google Drive to save any part of your work &ndash; make sure your code repository or cloud storage is private and do not share any links. This also applies after you have finished the course, as we do not want next year’s students accessing your solution, and plagiarism penalties can still apply after the course has finished.\n",
    "\n",
    "All submitted assignments will be run through plagiarism detection software to detect similarities to other submissions, including from past years. You should **carefully** read the UNSW policy on academic integrity and plagiarism (linked from the course web page), noting, in particular, that collusion (working together on an assignment, or sharing parts of assignment solutions) is a form of plagiarism.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, do not use any contract cheating “academies” or online “tutoring” services. This counts as serious misconduct with heavy penalties up to automatic failure of the course with 0 marks, and expulsion from the university for repeat offenders."

    "### Fuzzy Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "A CSP for this assignment is a set of variables representing tasks, binary constraints on pairs of tasks, and unary constraints (hard or soft) on tasks. The domains are all the working hours in one week, and a task duration is in hours. Days are represented (in the input and output) as strings ‘mon’, ‘tue’, ‘wed’, ‘thu’ and ‘fri’, and times are represented as strings ‘9am’, ‘10am’, ‘11am’, ‘12pm’, ‘1pm’, ‘2pm’, ‘3pm’, ‘4pm’ and ‘5pm’. The only possible values for the start and end times of a task are combinations of a day and times, e.g. ‘mon 9am’. Each task name is a string (with no spaces), and the only soft constraints are the soft deadline constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Binary Constraints:** These specify a hard requirement for the relationship between two tasks.\n",
    "- **Hard Domain Constraints:** These specify hard requirements for the tasks themselves.\n",
    "- **Soft Deadline Constraints:** These constraints specify that a task may finish late, but with a given cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each soft constraint has a function defining the *cost* associated with violating the preference, that the constraint solver must minimize, while respecting all the hard constraints. The *cost* of a solution is simply the sum of the costs for the soft constraints that the solution violates (and is always a non-negative integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the list of possible constraints for a fuzzy scheduling problem (comments below are for explanation and do **not** appear in the input specification; however, the code we supply *should* work with comments that take up a full line): \n",

    "Firstly, the domain splitting with arc consistency works as a Greedy best-first search with heuristic of cost being the sum of all minimum possible soft deadline violations per task (best case per domain). It is monotonic, meaning cost is non-decreasing throughout the search resulting in an optimal and complete method. The start state has all tasks with domains reduced to satisfy unary hard constraints, and prunes to ensure arc consistency (hard binary constraints satisfied). The successor function works by randomly choosing a task with size of domain >1, splitting the domain in half to produce two seperate states, then enforcing arc consistency of each by checking against hard binary constraints, and ordering states with lowest cost first on a priority queue. The search space includes any combination of task domains after splitting and pruning from the start state. The goal state involves a state where each task has a domain of size one, and all binary and unary hard constraints have been satisfied. \n",
    "\n",
    "The DFS solver involves randomly choosing a task an assigning a time with no regard to cost. The start state involves all tasks with domains reduced to satisfy only unary hard constraints. The successor function chooses a task arbitrarily, specifically in the order described in the problem specification, and assigns a time in the domain. If a binary violation occurs the searcher will backtrack through the search tree, and try a different assignment. The search space describes all possible combinations of assignments of tasks with unary constraints satisfied. The DFS solver traverses a tree with height as the number of tasks, and branching factor the size of the tasks domain. A goal state is an assignment of all tasks that also satisfies binary hard constraints, so all hard constraints are satisfied. \n",

    "The unary constraint on t1 restricts its domain to only early Monday times. Under arc consistency, this restriction propagates backwards through all binary 'before' constraints, forcing t2, t3, …, t6 to take even earlier times. As a result, all domains collapse to a single value each, and the AC-based solver reaches a goal state immediately with zero branching. DFS solver, however, does not propagate this constraint forward. It still tries many assignments for t2–t6, only discovering violations after deep recursive assignments, leading to a large number of node expansions (e.g., 2016 in empirical test). This shows that domain splitting with AC can solve some problems instantly by propagation, while DFS still explores a large search tree.\n",

    "The algorithm should find the domain time that incurs the minimum cost. More generally this should be done by finding the cost for every value in the domain. In pseudo-code 'best_cost = min(cost_function(v) for v in domain)'. However, because the only soft constraint is ends-by with a non-negative lateness penalty, finishing earlier never increases cost, and the earliest time can safely be chosen. This reduces computational time to find cost from O(d) per task to O(1), and hence from O(n*d) per node to O(n).\n",

    "The cost function never decreases along a path, because domains only shrink and never regain values.  Since we always calculate cost based on the best possible remaining domain value, shrinking the domain cannot reveal a better value that was previously unavailable. Therefore f(n) is monotonic non-decreasing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The priority queue always expands nodes in increasing order of f (cost). Because f is admissible (optimistic) and monotonic, once a goal state is dequeued, no other unexpanded node can lead to a better solution, as it would have been expanded earlier. Hence, the first goal state removed from the priority queue is guaranteed to be optimal. Hence the greedy solution is optimal."

    "Implementing the cost function guarantes optimality, as soft cost is an admissable monotonic heuristic, meaning nodes are expanded in non-decreasing order of estimated cost, guaranteeing that the first goal dequeued is the minimum-cost solution. In contrast, the solver without the cost heuristic, expands the children in an arbitrary order produced by Python’s unordered set partitioning. In practice the solver will take the 'left' partition of the split often taking the set of earlier times coincidentally leading to a low-cost solution, but this is not guaranteed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of the cost function will have little effect on the number of nodes expanded, rather the solver will take the minimum cost path leading to the optimal goal state, rather than some arbitrary goal state. There will be some additional overhead to implement calculate_cost(), with time complexity O(n) per node. However this will be negligible compared to potential costs to ensure arc consistency, which will be O(n·d<sup>2</sup>) under the assumption of one binary contraint per task. Thus, we expect little to no change in node expansion count, only in the order in which nodes are explored and the guarantee of optimality."

    "\n",
    "- What are the properties of the search algorithms (completeness, optimality)? (1 mark)\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, DFS solvers are incomplete as they can get caught in cycles or down a path of infinite depth. However, in this context, the search space is acyclic and finite. The solver will eventually explore the solution making DFS complete, however the solution may never be found for n>12 where exploring the entire search space isn't feasable due to computational cost. Adding the heuristic makes these larger problems much cheaper, although in the worst case, time complexity remains the same (evenly bound variables). \n",
    "\n",
    "Neither DFS or DFS with added heuristic is optimal. Both will terminate at the first goal state with all hard constraints satisfied with no regard for cost. The heuristic only makes the search faster. \n",

    "Problems with a few highly constrainted variables and large n will be much easier to solve. The heuristic will satisfy those with the smallest domain first, which tend to be the most constrained. By forcing assignment to to difficult variables first, paths are pruned much earlier instead of getting lost deep in the tree exploring failing partial assignments of highly constrained variables. This example specifically the dfs solver 'Nodes expanded to reach solution: 51968' whereas added heuristic 'Nodes expanded to reach solution: 9'\n",

    "- Empirically compare the quality of the first solution found by DFS and DFS-MRV compared to the optimal solution (1 mark)\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding runtime, the DFS without heuristic performs the worst of the 3 solvers, and begins to fail reliably at n>12, subbing into time complexity O(d<sup>n</sup>) becomes O(40<sup>12</sup>), this is an extremely large number and unlikely to be found by the solver in the worst case. DFS with heuristic performed similarly to the optimal solution of domain splitting with arc consistency and added cost heuristic. These were both found to take longer than 10 sec at fail at n = ~200. Performance of these solvers is subject to change based on the number and distribution of constraints however. \n",

The *minimum cost* for *v* is the lowest cost from amongst the values in the domain of *v*. The DFS solver should choose a variable *v* with lowest minimum cost, and explore its values in order of cost from lowest to highest.\n",

    "- Empirically compare the performance of DFS with and without these heuristics (2 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Refer to graph generated at the bottom of the above code for plotting and empirical comparison of methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "For DFS with cost heuristic, variables are ordered once at the root by their minimum soft-deadline penalty. This approximates ‘choose lowest-cost variable first’ without dynamically recomputing at each depth. This is safe as no domain shrinking occurs after the starting state prunes domains for unary constraints, so the minimum cost orderring will remain the same throughout the dfs_solver. \n",
    "\n",
    "Empirically, the optimality of the goal state with ordering by min cost variables first is very similar to plain DFS across all tested instances. While low cost variables are allocated first, this has the tradeoff that variables with higher costs are likely to be allocated later, incur more conflicts, and be allocated a worse time with a larger cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the performance on average was found to be slightly poorer when averaged across trials. More constrained nodes are more likely to incur a higher cost and be allocated last, deep in the recursion tree. Rather than conflicing domains being pruned higher and more efficiently. This results in the opposite effect of the MRV heuristic which forces highly constrained variables to be satisfied earlier, resulting in large performance gains. "

    "\n",
    "Partitioning the same problem into a range of k between 2 and 10 yields the same cost. This is because more partitions still maintain the optimality of the solver. As the monotonic cost function and greedy best-first expansion order are preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of paths expanded generally reduces the greater the value of k. Although the branching factor means more states must be evaluated by the solver, domains are shrunk faster, resulting in generally fewer nodes being expanded. This increased branching results in more nodes remaining on the frontier, so although less paths are expanded, a similar amount of nodes must still be evaluated by the solver. Additionally there is a greater memory cost associated with higher branching, as more nodes remain on the frontier enqueued in the priority queue per node popped. Additionally as the domain splits more aggressively, arc consistency applications per split might become slightly cheaper, having to check across a smaller domain space. More analysis beyond nodes expanded would be needed to evaluate the true runtime tradeoff. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Poole & Mackworth suggest, k = 2 strikes a balanced trade-off between domain reduction and branching overhead. Our results are consistent with this claim: while k > 2 sometimes reduced expansions, the added branching and memory pressure make it unclear that larger k provides a net benefit."
